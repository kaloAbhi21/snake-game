## Snake Game

This is a simple snake game made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game can be played on any web browser.

### How to Play

To play the game, simply use the arrow keys to move the snake. The snake will grow in length every time it eats an apple. The goal of the game is to avoid hitting the walls of the game board or the snake's own body.

### Controls

* Up arrow: Move the snake up
* Down arrow: Move the snake down
* Left arrow: Move the snake left
* Right arrow: Move the snake right

### Gameplay

The game starts with the snake in a small square in the center of the game board. An apple is randomly placed on the game board. The snake must eat the apple to grow in length.

The snake moves one grid square at a time. The snake cannot move through walls or its own body. If the snake hits a wall or its own body, the game is over.

The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows in length. The snake will move faster and it will be more difficult to avoid hitting the walls or its own body.

### Scoring

The score is calculated by counting the number of apples that the snake has eaten. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or its own body. The highest score is displayed at the end of the game.

### Tips

* Try to keep the snake in the center of the game board. This will make it easier to avoid hitting the walls.
* Eat the apple as soon as possible. This will make the snake grow in length and make the game more challenging.
* Be careful not to hit the snake's own body. This will end the game.

### Future Work

The following are some ideas for future work on this project:

* Add different difficulty levels.
* Add different game modes, such as a time trial mode or a survival mode.
* Add the ability to play against other players online.
* Deploy the game to the web so that it can be played on any device.

I hope this helps!
